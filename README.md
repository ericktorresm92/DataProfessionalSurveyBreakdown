#Data Professional Survey Breakdown

## Project Purpose:

This Power BI project appears to be focused on analyzing data from a survey of data professionals and analyzing their current status. To do this, we will focus on the following aspects:

1. Demographics of data professionals
Here, we will identify the countries from which most respondents come and their ages.

2. Income and job satisfaction
We will compare salaries across different roles in the data field, as well as the level of satisfaction with work-life balance and financial compensation.

3. Difficulties in entering the industry
We will determine how easy or difficult it is for new professionals to enter the data field and analyze potential barriers to entry, such as required experience or educational level.

4. Technology preferences
We will identify the most widely used programming languages in the data field and understand the tools most valued by professionals in the sector.

## Data Utilized:

## Methodology:
The dataset underwent data cleansing, value replacement, and some minor corrections in PowerBI. The roles, countries of origin, industry, and preferred survey programs were cleaned.
The annual salary range column was duplicated to provide a minimum and maximum salary in two columns. An average salary was then calculated in a separate column.
This led to the construction of a dashboard. Visually, the focus was on graphing participant count, average salary, preferred data analysis program, difficulty in accessing the data, and overall satisfaction.

## Results and Conclusions
It was found that the majority of respondents came from the United States, India, and the United Kingdom, and the average age of participants was approximately 29.87 years, indicating that most respondents were in an early or mid-career stage.
Regarding the profession's earnings, data scientists have the highest average salary compared to other roles such as data engineer, data architect, and data analyst. This indicates that data science specialization remains one of the most lucrative within the data field.
Satisfaction with work-life balance is rated 5.74 out of 10, suggesting a neutral or slightly positive perception. However, satisfaction with salary is lower (4.27 out of 10), indicating that many data professionals feel they could be better compensated.
Regarding difficulty entering the industry, a significant number of respondents consider entering the data industry "difficult" or "very difficult." This could indicate barriers such as lack of experience, high educational requirements, or lack of opportunities for beginners.
When studying popular languages, Python was found to be the most popular language among respondents, with a considerable difference over other languages such as R, SQL, and C/C++. Python is arguably the leading choice for data analysis and data science.

## Additional insights:
Companies can focus on improving salaries if they want to attract and retain data talent. More training programs could be created to facilitate the entry of new professionals into the industry. There is also an opportunity to explore options to improve the work-life balance of their employees and thus maintain a level of satisfaction and performance within the company.
